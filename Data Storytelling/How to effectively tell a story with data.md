# WHAT IS DATA STORYTELLING?
**Data storytelling** is the ability to effectively communicate **insights from a dataset** using narratives and visualizations. It can be used to put data insights into context for and inspire action from your audience.

There key components to data storytelling:
1. **Data**: Thorough analysis of accurate, complete data serves as the foundation of your data story. Analyzing data using descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analysis can enable you to understand its full picture.
2. **Narrative**: A verbal or written narrative, also called a storyline, is used to communicate insights gleaned from data, the context surrounding it, and actions you recommend and aim to inspire in your audience.
3. **Visualizations**: Visual representations of your data and narrative can be useful for communicating its story clearly and memorably. These can be charts, graphs, diagrams, pictures, or videos.


3 elements of a story: Set Up => Conflict => Resolution
SET UP: Just some reality. By reality, we just mean a situation. It could be fictional but it's a reality
CONFLICT: You have conflict, which has changed that reality. The term “conflict” is in this context an area or point of immediate or dramatic variance in the data
RESOLUTION: just the new reality that the change creates
